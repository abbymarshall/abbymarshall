## Hi there 👋

Commercial operator with a background in SaaS customer success and ESG technology.

Currently building technical fluency in:
	•	SQL
	•	Marketing analytics
	•	Funnel modelling
	•	AI-assisted workflows

I’m particularly interested in:
	•	B2B growth
	•	Pipeline optimisation
	•	AI-first marketing systems
	•	Voice & AI infrastructure

Recent Projects:
	•	B2B Marketing Funnel Analysis (SQL)
	•	SaaS Retention Analysis
	•	AI-driven copy experimentation

I believe commercial execution improves when operators can think in data.
